# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for the project was to allow me to develop my skills with coding and to push forward. That motivation lead me to build the project since it was previously out of bounds for me. I would not have built this without motivation and guidance to show me how I can go past my limits with coding. This solves my issues of not knowing where to start and what limits I had previously. I did all of this so I could learn about the different aspects for building a webpage. There are multiple layers to a webpage that I had not originally known until now.
